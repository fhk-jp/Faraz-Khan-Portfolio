# Assignment 3&4: Critique by Design

This week, we were tasked to find, critique, and re-think an existing visualization. As someone who is very interested in immigration policy and reads the news frequently, I decided to pick a visualization depicting the increasing number of asylum seekers denied entry into the United States. This is a sensitive issue, and I decided to focus on the [research conducted at Syracuse University](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/539/). Below, I share my process for finding the visualizations, my first reactions and wireframing, and re-creating the visualization.
