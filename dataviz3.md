# Assignment 3&4: Critique by Design

This week, we were tasked to find, critique, and re-create an existing visualization. As someone who is very interested in immigration policy and reads the news frequently, I decided to pick a visualization depicting the increasing number of asylum seekers denied entry into the United States. This is a sensitive issue, and I decided to focus on the [research conducted at Syracuse University](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/539/). Below, I share my process for finding the visualization, my first reactions and wireframing ideas, and re-creating the visualization.

## Step 1: Finding a Visualization
I used the data provided by Syracuse University on the number of asylum seekers accepted and denied entry into the United States. This project has been cited by various news sources, such as the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/us/31asylum.html), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/burgeoning-court-backlog-of-more-than-850000-cases-undercuts-trump-immigration-agenda/2019/05/01/09c0b84a-6b69-11e9-a66d-a82d3f3d96d5_story.html), and others. I decided to peruse the study's website and found visualizations created by the research team:
