# Final Project - Part II

## Storyboard Presentation:

As part of part one, I developed a story arc focused on gentrification of neighborhoods in the United States. While it is difficult to measure gentrification accurately, there are various studies and definitions that make it more clear. There are many cities that are gentrifying at fast rates, but I decided to focus on Chicago, which is where I grew up. I decided to use the methodology used by [Governining](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/chicago-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html) for my analysis. Of course, gentrification refers to the change in places over time and therefore, I decided to use data from 2000 and 2010, respectively, to highlight change. I gathered data on median household income, median home values, and percentage of individuals over the age of 25 who earned Bachelor's degrees. These are the three key variables I plan to use. I will collect tract-level data, but later aggregate it to neighborhood-level since people are more familiar with neighborhood boundaries than tracts in Chicago.

## User Research Process:

I created a few sketches to present to four friends and approached them informally for their feedback. I asked them the following four questions: (1) Do you understand what gentrification is better? (2) Is my storyline complete or should I add something else? (3) What were your favorite parts and why? and (4) Is there something you think I should elaborate on? This all happened while we were studying together over the weekend. Although, I was sure to separate them and talk to them one-on-one to avoid redundant feedback.

## Protocol & Feedback:

My target audience is anyone who is interested in gentrification, people moving to Chicago who may be interested in learning more about neighborhoods, and former and current "gentrifiers". I asked a group of graduate students who are going to earn higher salaries and move to big cities upon graduation. These are people who could be gentrifiers and need to know what the impacts on the community can be. 

### Interview Script:
"Hi _____. As you know, I am currently enrolled in a Data Visualization course at Heinz. I am working on a final project on gentrification and will be focusing on my hometown, Chicago. I would love to hear your thoughts on my story. I am specifically looking for feedback on (1) if my story makes sense  and (2) what are some of the ways my visualizations can be made more appealing and interactive. Let's get started!"

#### Selected responses to first question: Do you understand what gentrification is better?
Person#1: "Yeah, I guess the only thing I don't really follow is how you go from U.S. to Chicago. That can be improved by saying something a little more."

Person#2: "Yes, the definition really helped even though I knew about it before I even read it. Is there a way you can maybe condense it or make some things stand out?"

Person#3: "Yeah, I am curious to see the picture you're thinking of and wanna see how you're going to visualize it. I can almost picture it in my head, but wanna see what you come up with!"

Person#4: "Hmmm, I do, but I am confused by a few elements in the story. It may be because I am just tired so sorry about that. I am going to have think about it and I'll come back to it, but generally, yes."

#### Selected responses to second question: Is my storyline complete or should I add something else?
Person#1: "Yes and no. To be honest, it kinda feels a bit messy and can incorporate more text than you have. I thing the only thing I am still not sure is why you focus on Chicago and then a particular neighborhood, so make that clear. Also, I think if you focus on a neighborhood, you need more information such as comparisons between 2000 and 2010 on other factors."

Person#2: "I followed most of it, but I just need to see it with graphics to really get it. I think your idea to include visuals is solid, but I still don't know what your methodology is. Can you break it down for me?"

Person#3: "It's complete, but I am curious to know why you didn't use race as another factor? When I think of gentrification, I think of people of color being kicked out, so I would love to see some stats or something on that."

Person#4: "It's complete. But, why do you show these maps one at a time? Why not just use the map that shows the neighborhoods eligible to gentrify? That may make it more clear."

#### Selected responses to third question: What were your favorite parts and why?
Person#1: "I love the big statistic of 20%. I had no idea and that's a pretty big number!"

Person#2: "I like the definition a lot and I am glad you started broad. Even though I knew gentrification before, I think it makes it more clear to the reader!"

Person#3: "I am proud of you for using GIS! That's awesome and I am looking forward to these maps all color-coded and stuff! I am a visual learner so this will make things more fun for me."

Person#4: "I really like the call-to-action. I think that's something people often forget and I love that you put that in there and I can actually do all of them as someone who is passionate about this stuff."

#### Selected responses to fourth question: Is there something you think I should elaborate on?
Person#1: Again, make it more clear to me why you chose Chicago. That can make it way better."

Person#2: "I think the neighborhood part needs more statistics. If you can find some that are interesting, it can be great to share."

Person#3: "Define your problem statement more. This may not seem like a problem to some."

Person#4: "Yeah, I think maybe the format can be more interactive and pictures can certainly help!"

#### Feedback Incorporated on Page#1:
- Emphasized certain words in the definition to make it stand out more.
- Added more context on why Chicago.

#### Feedback Incorporated on Page#2:
- Added why gentrification is a problem in the problemt statement.
- Made methodology more clear to the reader by higlighting percentiles and benchmarks.

#### Feedback Incorporated on Pages#3-6:
- Changed the intervals to say "gain" instead of "increase" and added "decrease" after a friend pointed out that populations could also decrease given certain parameters. 
- Added broader intervals and more categories to show the spread.
- Made the map colors more visually appealing and more neutraL.
- Completed the maps using test data in ArcGIS.

#### Feedback Incorporated on Page#7:
- Added more information on why Pilsen and how gentrification affected longtime residents of Pilsen.
- Need to do more research on changes in income and other factors (to be continued).

#### Feedback Incorporated on Page#8:
- Call to Action was well-received and I received very little feedback on it. Just made it more visually appealing .

## Reflection

Overall, I really enjoyed hearing people's ideas and quickly realized how difficult this topic is to visualize. I will do my best to make sure it is clear and concise and plan to meet with Professor Goransen over the next two weeks to get his feedback. I realized the value in seeking feedback from others because that were obvious to me were not as obvious to them. I also liked their candidness, even though they were my friends. I am looking forward to continuing working on this!
