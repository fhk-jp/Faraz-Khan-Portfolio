# Final Project - Part II

## Storyboard Presentation:

As part of part one, I developed a story arc focused on gentrification of neighborhoods in the United States. While it is difficult to measure gentrification accurately, there are various studies and definitions that make it more clear. There are many cities that are gentrifying at fast rates, but I decided to focus on Chicago, which is where I grew up. I decided to use the methodology used by [Governining](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/chicago-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html) for my analysis. Of course, gentrification refers to the change in places over time and therefore, I decided to use data from 2000 and 2010, respectively, to highlight change. I gathered data on median household income, median home values, and percentage of individuals over the age of 25 who earned Bachelor's degrees. These are the three key variables I plan to use. I will collect tract-level data, but later aggregate it to neighborhood-level since people are more familiar with neighborhood boundaries than tracts in Chicago.

## User Research Process:

I created a few sketches to present to four friends and approached them informally for their feedback. I asked them the following four questions: (1) Do you understand what gentrification is better? (2) Is my storyline complete or should I add something else? (3) What were your favorite parts and why? and (4) Is there something you think I should elaborate on? This all happened while we were studying together over the weekend. Although, I was sure to separate them and talk to them one-on-one to avoid redundant feedback.

## Protocol & Feedback:

My target audience is anyone who is interested in gentrification, people moving to Chicago who may be interested in learning more about neighborhoods, and former and current "gentrifiers". I asked a group of graduate students who are going to earn higher salaries and move to big cities upon graduation. These are people who could be gentrifiers and need to know what the impacts on the community can be. 

### Interview Script:
"Hi _____. As you know, I am currently enrolled in a Data Visualization course at Heinz. I am working on a final project focused on gentrification and will be focusing on my hometown, Chicago. I would love to hear your thoughts on my story. I am specifically looking for feedback on (1) if my story makes sense  and (2) what are some of the ways my visualizations can be made more appealing and interactive. Let's get started!"
