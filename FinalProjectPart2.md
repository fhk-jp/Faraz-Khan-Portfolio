# Final Project - Part II

## Storyboard Presentation:

As part of part one, I developed a story arc focused on gentrification of neighborhoods in the United States. While it is difficult to measure gentrification accurately, there are various studies and definitions that make it more clear. There are many cities that are gentrifying at fast rates, but I decided to focus on Chicago, which is where I grew up. I decided to use the methodology used by [Governining](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/chicago-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html) for my analysis. Of course, gentrification refers to the change in places over time and therefore, I decided to use data from 2000 and 2010, respectively, to highlight change. I gathered data on median household income, median home values, and percentage of individuals over the age of 25 who earned Bachelor's degrees. These are the three key variables I plan to use. I will collect tract-level data, but later aggregate it to neighborhood-level since people are more familiar with neighborhood boundaries than tracts in Chicago.

## User Research:

I created a few sketches to present to four friends and approached them informally for their feedback. I asked them the following four questions: (1) Do you understand what gentrification is better? (2) Is my storyline complete or should I add something else? (3) What were your favorite parts and why? and (4) Is there something you think I should elaborate on?

Here's the version I shared with them:
