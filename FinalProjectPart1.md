# Final Project - Part 1

## Outline
For my final project, I will be focusing on gentrification in Chicago between 2000 and 2010. I am a proud Chicagoan and would like to learn more about the effects that gentrification has had on the city's poor and nonwhite communities. Gentrification is a highly controversial topic, but I hope to bring light to the issues it causes through trends in terms of housing prices, displacement of racial minority groups, and income inequality. Specifically, I will be comparing statistics at the beginning of the decade (2000) and the at the end of the decade (2010). This project is largely inspired by the folks at [Governing]( https://www.governing.com/gov-data/chicago-gentrification-maps-demographic-data.html) and similar to them, I am definining "gentrification" as the following:

###### "An increase in a tract's educational attainment, as measured by the percentage of residents age 25 and over        holding bachelor’s degrees, was in the top third percentile of all tracts within a metro area. A tract’s median home      value increased when adjusted for inflation. The percentage increase in a tract’s inflation-adjusted median home value    was in the top third percentile of all tracts within a metro area."

I will be using Shorthand for my project. The project will open with key terms (i.e. gentrification, displacement, etc.) and then highlight a key figure (“X% of neighborhoods with lower incomes and home values in Chicago experienced gentrification between 2000 and 2010”). Next, I’ll introduce before-and-after images of neighborhoods that experienced “severe gentrification” and tell an interesting story about (“Logan Square was run by X% local business owners…and now, it’s X%). I will move onto interactive maps that show the “hot spots” or areas that were severely gentrified and also compare key statistics such as median household income, housing prices, etc. between 2000 and 2010. I will end by unpacking myths about gentrification and unpack them using data visualizations. The call-to-action at the end will include information on supporting local businesses, advocating for fair housing policies, connecting with local representatives, and voting in local elections.

## Data
The publicly available datasets (see below) will allow me to conduct in-depth analysis and tell a story about the effects of gentrification. I need information from 2000 to 2010 to show the change, which will require me to utilize two datasets for each predictor (median value of home, percentage of those possessing a Bachelor's degree, and median household income).

#### Median Value of Home:
[Median Value of Home, by Census Tract (2010 ACS 5-Year Estimate)](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_SF4_B25077&prodType=table)

[Median Value of Home, by Census Tract (2000 SF-4)](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_00_SF4_HCT066&prodType=table)

#### Percentage of the population 25+ years of age holding a Bachelor’s Degree:
[Bachelor’s Degree for Population 25+ Years Old (2010 ACS 5-Year Estimate)](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_5YR_S1501&prodType=table)

[Bachelor’s Degree for Population 25+ Years Old (2000 SF-3)](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_00_SF3_QTP20&prodType=table)

#### Median Household Income (Inflation-Adjusted):

## Method & Medium
I will be using Shorthand and relying on bold callouts, interactive maps, and embedded images to tell this story. The story will rely on scrolling and honing on certain elements to help the reader understand the visualizations. FOr example, for maps, it may be easy for the reader to see the hot spots, but highlighting a particular neighborhod and providing more background could be helpful. Additionally, the story will progress in a linear fashion and go from big-picture definitons to specific examples of the effects of gentrification.

The story will conclude with a few call-to-actions. The first will focus on supporting local businesses and linking to a website that allows them to do that; the second will allow to advocate for fair housing policies and see bills/online petitions; the third will allow them to connect with representative in their area directly to implement policy change; and the last will focus on registering to vote in the upcoming local elections.
